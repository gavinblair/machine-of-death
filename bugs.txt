timer switching between screens is kindof weird. put the timer outside of the h2. keep the on/off switch.

reset the timer between targets (start a new timer isn't working)

"0 targets left. get next target"

finishedtime function is wrong - don't go to the aftermath if time is up

draw at black market stage - if deck runs out, you lose
